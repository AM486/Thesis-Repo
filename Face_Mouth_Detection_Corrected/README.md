##### Face - Mouth Detection
==============
I am using Python and OpenCV 3.1.0. I managed to contain the detection but the algorithm is too slow yet. 

In the [robust_recognition_1.py](https://github.com/arvartho/Thesis-Repo/blob/master/Face_Mouth_Detection_Corrected/enhanced_recognition_1.py) I tried to contain the mouth detection for the dimention of the max upper bound which is greater than h/2.

In the [robust_recognition_2.py](https://github.com/arvartho/Thesis-Repo/blob/master/Face_Mouth_Detection_Corrected/enhanced_recognition_2.py) I tried to contain the mouth detection for the dimention of the upper bound > h/2.
