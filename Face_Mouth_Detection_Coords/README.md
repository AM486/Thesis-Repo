##### Face - Mouth Detection
==============
I am using Python and OpenCV 3.1.0. I managed to contain the detection but the algorithm is too slow yet. 
In the robust_recognition_1.py I tried to contain the mouth detection for the dimention of the max upper bound which is greater than h/2.
In the robust_recognition_2.py I tried to contain the mouth detection for the dimention of the upper bound > h/2.
